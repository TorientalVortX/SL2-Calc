The Excel line of weapons were developed in Chaturanga, where the ability to be defensive while increasing offensive capabilities was highly valued. By charging up the weapon, it can explosively spend the focus energy when it strikes an enemy, greatly increasing damage. However, the engine module makes it heavier than other weapons.
