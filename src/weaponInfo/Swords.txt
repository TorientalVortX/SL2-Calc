Damage Type: Slash | Subtype: Katana
Details: On Hit: Deals magic Ice bonus damage equal to 50% of your Ice ATK, which ignores armor. Grants Skill: Everblue (3 Momentum, 10 FP) - Targets a tile up to 8 Range away that contains an enemy or plant special tile. Creates Ice Sheets in the line along from your current location to that tile, which last 3 rounds. Plant special tiles are frozen and turn into dense ice statues. If an enemy is the target and they are a Plant, they are inflicted with Frozen LV 10 for 2 rounds, but this skill enters a 3 round cooldown. An icy katana that gives nature a respite.
