10★ Staff of Eyes
Range: 1 | Power: 13 | Accuracy: 85% | Critical: 0% | Crit Damage: 115% | Weight: 13
Scaling: Tool, Darkness - 40% STR, 40% RES

This rod was most likely cultivated on a miniature planet, its seed taking root at the very center to give birth to the colossal (relatively) tree that ended up being it, after it absorbed all life around it. In our universe's standards, it's not very big, but would make a good walking stick.

Scaling: Sylphid - 70% STR, 40% CEL

Grants Skill: Winged Spearstrike (3 Momentum, 10 FP) - Tosses your Winged Spear in a line, reducing its durability by 2, where it will travel up to 6 Range away. If it hits an enemy, it will deal Wind magic damage to them equal to 125% of Wind ATK + UL*2. This spear has wings, no bulls required. They almost seem... alive, in a way, it's disturbing. But whatever magic holds it together will let you use those wings almost as if they were your own. That, and the spear is capable of flying quite far and returning, in a special type of attack.

Upon use, the user gains a copy of positive status(es) all enemies have, except permanent ones, including the LV, duration, etc. (Mirror Armor: Grants a percentage of automatic retaliation of magic damage, based on level (max: 20%). Physical damage will shatter then mirrors for the rest of the round, preventing the retaliation effect, but will reduce the LUC of the damager for the rest of the battle, as breaking mirrors is unlucky.) A flash of brilliance in a shallow pond... A prism of pain that reflects the faces of agony that it inflicts upon your foes.

If you have Grypon Storm, this skill gains additional effects based on its LV: LV5+: If you have an unsummoned Hippogriph (and can summon it), summons it to a tile near you. LV10+: +1 Circle Size. Chance to inflict Lingering Wind Damage LV X (X = Gryphon Storm LV) for 2 rounds. With a feather-like texture, you'd think this whip would be soft, but being struck by it is anything but. In fact, the more it strikes, the wilder it gets, kicking up the winds around you.
