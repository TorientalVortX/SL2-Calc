4★ Daikyu
Range: 3 | Power: 12 | Accuracy: 80% | Critical: 0% | Crit Damage: 110% | Weight: 14
Scaling: Basic - 100% STR
Details: When you are two-handing this weapon, it gains +2 Farshot Bonus. Potential Skill - Daikyu Snipe (3 Momentum, 15 FP) - Daikyu's Potential Skill. Targets 1 unoccupied tile within 1 Range and fires a long-reaching arrow from the Daikyu, which travels up to 15 tiles away. The first enemy hit by the arrow is attacked by the Daikyu with no Farshot Penalty. If the bow is fitted with Light Arrows, this arrow cannot be reflected, dispells Darkness tiles it passes near, and gains +100 Critical against Supernatural enemies. If you have 40+ FAI, it also creates Sanctuary tiles (LV 1, 2 rounds). The daikyu is a longbow with an irregular draw, positioned below the center of the bow. This makes the bow well-suited for use on horseback, as the bow is less likely to catch on the horse. However, the stress on the wood requires greater levels of maintenance, and its draw form is different from standard bows. Someone using a daikyu without the proper training will not have a functional one for long.

If you have 40+ FAI, attacking a field object while in Firing Posture applies this bonus damage to all enemies in 3 Range of it. The hankyu is a more compact version of the daikyu bow, with an irregular, uneven draw slightly below the center of the bow. While its power at long distances is less impressive than its sister bow, its smaller body allows it to be used for low profile shooting, such as when ducking.
